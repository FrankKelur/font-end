As the development of technology, governments invest more money to space programmes. Some people hold the view that these money will be better spent on vital services. I totally disagree with this, though investment on vital public service is necessary, we should take efforts to space programmes which might have great impact on our lives in the future.

In contemporary society, Science and technology play a more and more important role. they involve one country's influence and the facility of our daily lives. Space programmes represents the topest level of human technology, it might contribute to human's imigration to space in the future. What's more, if we could find other civilization or find some rare valuable materials, we might get breakthrough of our current technology. For example, artificial technology was thought as waste money project for it's output cannot make up for it's investment, but finally it turned out be a revolutionary technology.

Some people said that we should spend those money on vital public services such as schools and hospitals, which will benefit our lives immediately. It will help the poor get better education and better medical treatment, which certainly contributes to stability of society. But I am fully conviced by that we cannot sacriface our technology development for a short-term social welfare. If we curtail the money on space programmes research, we might benefit a little temporarily but we might lose more in a long-term future.

We should know that the importance of space programmes can never be overemphasized. Governments should pay as high attention to space programmes as to social walfare. Only by this way, can we get a briliant and promising future.
